Web scraping, often called web crawling or web spidering, or “programmatically going over a collection of web pages and extracting data,” is a powerful tool for working with data on the web.

With a web scraper, you can mine data about a set of products, get a large corpus of text or quantitative data to play around with, get data from a site without an official API, or just satisfy your own personal curiosity.
If you look at the page we want to scrape, you’ll see it has the following structure:

There’s a header that’s present on every page.
There’s some top-level search data, including the number of matches, what we’re searching for, and the breadcrumbs for the site.
Then there are the sets themselves, displayed in what looks like a table or ordered list. Each set has a similar format.
Take another look at the HTML for a specific set:

brickset.com/sets/year-2016
<article class="set">
  <a class="highslide plain mainimg" href="http://images.brickset.com/sets/images/10251-1.jpg?201510121127" onclick="return hs.expand(this)">
    <img src="http://images.brickset.com/sets/small/10251-1.jpg?201510121127" title="10251-1: Brick Bank"></a>
  ...
  <div class="meta">
    <h1><a href="/sets/10251-1/Brick-Bank"><span>10251:</span> Brick Bank</a> </h1>
    ...
    <div class="col">
      <dl>
        <dt>Pieces</dt>
        <dd><a class="plain" href="/inventories/10251-1">2380</a></dd>
        <dt>Minifigs</dt>
        <dd><a class="plain" href="/minifigs/inset-10251-1">5</a></dd>
        ...
      </dl>
    </div>
    ...
  </div>
</article>
We can see a few things by examining this code:

The image for the set is stored in the src attribute of an img tag inside an a tag at the start of the set. We can use another CSS selector to fetch this value just like we did when we grabbed the name of each set.
Getting the number of pieces is a little trickier. There’s a dt tag that contains the text Pieces, and then a dd tag that follows it which contains the actual number of pieces. We’ll use XPath, a query language for traversing XML, to grab this, because it’s too complex to be represented using CSS selectors.
Getting the number of minifigs in a set is similar to getting the number of pieces. There’s a dt tag that contains the text Minifigs, followed by a dd tag right after that with the number.
